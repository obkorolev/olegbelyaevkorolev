  Talking recently to my dear cousin, we discussed the endless possibilities that are arising from the exponential development of artificial intelligence, and how the future is being shaped by these intellects. Is dark illustration the future of human society? Or by contrary the conception of a new era: without boundaries, without death, with unlimited and unmatched knowledge that will guide the mankind to see attack ships on fire off the shoulder of Orion and C-beams glitter in the dark near the Tannh√§user Gate?

  My cousin's thoughts on a traditional paper were put together using an LLM, resulting in an eloquent, optimistic reflection about what lies ahead of us. Dear friends, please enjoy.
