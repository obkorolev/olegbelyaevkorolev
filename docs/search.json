    "text": "Hey, I’m happy you are here\n\n \n\nThanks for stopping by!   I am a post-doctoral researcher at the Institute of Marine Sciences of Andalusia (ICMAN-CSIC). My research interests include the application of remote sensing tools (e.g. drone and satellite imagery) to address coastal environmental phenomena.   I am currently working on several research projects, focusing on polar research in penguin colonies on Deception and Livingston Islands (South Shetland Islands), as well as on the development and optimization of deep learning techniques to study the spatial distribution and phenology of some of the most vulnerable ecological communities found in coastal ecosystems, such as seagrass meadows and microphytobenthic mudflats.\n\n  \n\nMy background\n\n\n\nPrior to joining ICMAN-CSIC, I completed a Bachelor’s degree in Marine Sciences and a Master’s degree in Oceanography at the University of Cádiz (UCA, Spain). In 2017, during the third year of my Bachelor’s program in Marine Sciences at UCA, I began collaborating on scientific research with Dr. Laura del Río in the Department of Earth Sciences. Later, I received a Collaboration Scholarship to fund my Master’s thesis project under the supervision of Professor Dr. Luis Barbero. For this project, I used drone technology with thermal sensors to detect submarine groundwater discharges in coastal areas.   In 2020, I began my scientific career at the Institute of Marine Sciences of Andalusia (ICMAN-CSIC, Spain), where I pursued a PhD focused on developing remote sensing tools and using sensors onboard drones to study coastal environmental processes. Funded by the PhD Fellowship for University Staff Training (FPU, ref: FPU19/04557), I worked under Dr. Antonio Tovar-Sánchez and Dr. Gabriel Navarro. During this time, I specialized in researching various marine ecosystems and characterizing diverse coastal environmental processes, such as seagrass meadows, penguin colonies, and algal blooms. As a result, I participated in six research projects, including two polar projects (PiMetAn and DICHOSO), and published 13 peer-reviewed articles, nine of which I was the first author, in leading journals in the fields of Remote Sensing, Oceanography, and Multidisciplinary Sciences. I completed my PhD in July 2024, graduating with the highest honors, summa cum laude.   I also shared my work with a broader audience at national and international conferences and expanded my training through three research stays abroad. From February to June 2022, at the University of Malta, under the supervision of Dr. Adam Gauci, I enhanced my Python programming skills specifically for drone operations over aquatic surfaces. Later, from October to November 2022, I was at the University of Nantes, working with Dr. Laurent Barillé on multispectral monitoring of oyster farming areas and the study of microphytobenthos in estuarine systems. Most recently, from September 2023 to February 2024, I developed Python techniques to improve marine optics algorithms for water quality studies using multispectral drone sensors at the University of Maryland. This research stay was funded by a Fulbright scholarship and supervised by Dr. Greg Silsbe.\n\n\nMap of my research activity\n\n \n\n\n• University of Cádiz (UCA): From September 2016 to July 2019, BSc and MSc studies.  • Institute of Marine Sciences of Andalusia (ICMAN-CSIC): From October 2020 to July 2024, PhD host institution.  • University of Malta (UM): From February 2022 to June 2022, PhD stay.  • Nantes University (NU): From October 2022 to November 2022, PhD stay.  • University of Maryland Center for Environmental Sciences (UMCES): From August 2023 to February 2024, PhD stay."
